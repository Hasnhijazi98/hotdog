Each of the following .rar files (ABM1 - ABM2 - ABM3) contains the different architectures (Centralized - Tree - Distributed) for the WSN with each 3 types of delay messages, and ABM is abbreviation of agent-based model, we did the simulation under 3 different environment simulations.
The goal of the project is to Study the effects and impact of the environment changes on the WSN performance under different archtiectures and CPU modes.
