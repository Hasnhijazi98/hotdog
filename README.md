Each of the following .rar files (ABM1 - ABM2 - ABM3) contains the different architectures (Centralized - Tree - Distributed) for the WSN with each 3 types of delay messages, and ABM is abbreviation of agent-based model, we did the simulation under 3 different environment simulations.
The goal of the project is to Study the effects and impact of the environment changes on the WSN performance under different archtiectures and CPU modes.
The Results folder contains Screenshots of power consumption of the 27 different scenarios, each screenshot is named  in the formm of #-#-# first letter indicates the architecture (D for distributed - C for centralized - H for hierarchical/tree), second letter for the CPU/message delay (S for slow - M for average - F for fast) and lastly a number indicating which agent-based environment model was applied (1 - 2 - 3)
